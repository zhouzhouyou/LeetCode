//A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in t
//he diagram below). 
//
// The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot 
//is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the d
//iagram below). 
//
// Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths 
//would there be? 
//
// 
//
// An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid. 
//
// Note: m and n will be at most 100. 
//
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input:
//[
//  [0,0,0],
//  [0,1,0],
//  [0,0,0]
//]
//Output: 2
//Explanation:
//There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
//There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
//1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
//2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
